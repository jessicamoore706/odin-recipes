    <h1>Gluten Free Bread</h1>

    <div class="description">

    <p>With a soft and tender crumb, this white gluten free bread recipe is the original and best. The bread bends and squishes, tastes like the “real thing”, and has a beautiful bakery-style crust. It tastes and behaves just like “regular” bread. If you follow this easy recipe faithfully, you'll get perfect bread every time.</p>

    <p>This batter-style gluten free yeast bread dough is more like a loose cookie dough than it is conventional bread dough. You need a stand mixer with a paddle attachment to mix it, most definitely not a dough hook since it isn't stretchy like conventional yeast bread dough.</p>

    <p>It’s a bit fragile once it’s risen, so handle with care. If you’d like to add seeds to this gluten free bread, do it and after the dough has risen. Just brush the top lightly with melted butter and sprinkle with seeds. But be gentle or you'll ruin the rise.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all purpose gluten free flour blend</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons xanthan gum <em>omit if your blend already contains it</em></li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm milk</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter <em>melted and cooled</em></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 egg whites <em>at room temperature</em></li>
        <li>Toasted sesame seeds for sprinkling <em>optional</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Grease or line a 9-inch x 5-inch loaf pan (or slightly smaller) and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, place the flour, xanthan gum, yeast, cream of tartar and sugar. Whisk together with a separate, handheld whisk. Add the salt, and whisk again to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, butter, vinegar and egg whites, mixing on low speed after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the mixer bowl as necessary during mixing.</li>
        <li>Turn the mixer to medium-high speed and mix for about 3 minutes. The dough will be thick, smooth and quite wet.</li>
        <li>Scrape the dough into the prepared loaf pan. Using a wet spatula, smooth the top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with lightly oiled plastic wrap and allow it to rise in a warm, draft-free place for 30 to 45 minutes or until it’s about 150% of its original size.</li>
        <li>It should be overflowing the top of the loaf pan by at least 1/2 inch when you retrieve it, but it will not have doubled in volume. It may take longer to rise properly in colder, drier weather and less time in warmer, more humid weather.</li>
        <li>When the dough has nearly reached the end of its rise, preheat the oven to 375°F.</li>
        <li>Remove the plastic wrap, and using a sharp knife or lame slash the top of the loaf about 1/4-inch deep. If using the optional seeds, brush the top of the risen bread gently with melted butter, and sprinkle with the seeds.</li>
        <li>Place the pan in the center of the preheated oven. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the internal temperature of the bread reaches about 195°F on an instant-read thermometer. The outside will form a thick, brown crust.</li>
        <li>Remove the loaf from the oven, and allow it to cool for about 10 minutes in the pan before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>To freeze this bread, cool completely and then slice, wrap tightly, and freeze. Defrost as many slices at a time as you need in the toaster.</li>
    </ol>
