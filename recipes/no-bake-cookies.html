    <p>No Bake Cookies are such a nostalgic childhood favorite! This recipe has that classic chocolate peanut butter flavor combo and the perfect chewy, fudgy texture. And I’m pretty sure they’re the easiest cookies on the planet to make!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) salted butter</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar</em></li>
        <li>1/3 cup (32g) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (160g) creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>3 cups (275g) quick oats <em>don't use old fashioned oats</em></li>
    
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or set out approximately 29 cupcake liners.</li>
        <li>In a 2.5 to 3 quart medium saucepan combine butter, sugar, cocoa, and milk.</li>
